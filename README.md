# My Ethernaut Journey

## About The Ethernaut 
[The Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) is an interactive wargame developed by OpenZeppelin that teaches smart contract security through hands-on challenges. Each level presents a vulnerable smart contract that players must exploit to advance, covering key security concepts such as reentrancy, integer overflows, and access control flaws.

## My Purpose
This repository documents my solutions and insights as I progress through Ethernaut. My goal is to deepen my understanding of Web3 security, enhance my Solidity auditing skills, and build a strong foundation for secure smart contract development. By sharing my solutions, I aim to reinforce my learning while contributing to the broader security community.

## Repository Structure
All challenge contracts and explanations will be organized under the ./ethernaut-challenges/ folder. Each challenge will include:

The original contract from Ethernaut
A detailed explanation of the vulnerability
The exploit used to complete the challenge

**Disclaimer:** This repository is for educational purposes only. The solutions and insights shared here are intended to help developers understand smart contract security and prevent vulnerabilities. They should not be used for unethical or malicious activities.
